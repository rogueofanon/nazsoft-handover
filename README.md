# Handover for Nazsoft Tech
---
Here is a handover github link for all of the things that I've completed in this time. 

From weeks 1 - 3 we worked on developing an API that provides JSON responses to be used with the Enterstripe app.

From weeks 4 - 5 we worked on developing a webscraper to scrape tender data from the Internet. 
You can find the code used for the MySQL database in the Google Drive folder.

In week 6 we worked with whole slide imaging (WSI), and continued exploring WSI and transfer learning in weeks 10 - onwards.

From weeks 7 - 10 we started to research and look into how to perform OCR on Jawi text so that it can be recognised and replicated by the computer.
- We attempted to train PyTesseract using the information in the [PyTesseract documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/tess5/TrainingTesseract-5.html#introduction). These files can be found in the TesseractTesting folder.
